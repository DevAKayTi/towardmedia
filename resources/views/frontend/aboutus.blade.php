        <h1 class="display-6">About Us</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Towards Website is one of the collaborative networking strategies of Impact- 360 with the Universities
            Students’ Unions Alumni Force and the Alliance of Students’ Unions. Very first initiatives of this
            website
            are Towards Newsletter and the podcast.

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            When the revolution had started, people began to rebel against the military junta by non-violent
            movements
            such as Civil Disobedience Movement, protesting and various types of strikes. In those times, people
            were in
            their ways and no one knew how to effectively participate in the revolution. So, young activists from
            the
            Universities Students’ Unions Alumni Force and the Alliance of Students’ Unions brainstormed that the
            people
            might need to be guided by a certain type of literacy. Later in March 2021, they began to publish a
            newsletter called Towards Newsletter (Si Tho in Burmese).
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            The team members started to collect the articles, poems, comics, cartoons and novels. The newsletter is
            full
            of demonstrations and creations reflecting the historian and current situations in Burma. First of all,
            they
            distributed the newsletter papers in person in the markets, junctions and crowded areas. Amongst the
            arrests, the distribution was no longer able to be effective and they changed into online publishing.
            Now,
            the newsletter is promoting public awareness via online in which people can learn how to keep the
            revolution
            going.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            The Newsletters have contributed to the revolution with accurate information and credible analysis which
            will endorse the mass movements to sustain and succeed in the long run. The communication and outreach
            team
            of Impact-360 has deployed necessary work and strategies. In our program, we have successfully published
            one
            issue per week (March 2021 - Present). Not only that, we have also released several momentous issues
            based
            on historic events. Our weekly newsletters were published not only on our social media page but also on
            other social media accounts/ pages of youth activists & Students’ Unions.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            The podcast program also gained support from writers who want to express revolutionary articles. The
            podcast
            program is interconnected and supports the other programs under this project. Especially through the
            educating perspectives, the podcast program is intended to complement young students' empowerment and
            capacity building program. The podcast will be launched for educational purposes.
            Finally, we made an international expansion of our networking to contribute our efforts and
            progressivity.
            That is why we designed and launched this website to acquire updates of Spring Revolution and the
            youths’
            activities. On this website, you are able to see the literary arts of young activists from Myanmar and
            their
            invaluable participation in the revolution.
